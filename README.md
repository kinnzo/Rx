**Introduction**
   ```
    You might go to a doctor and get a prescription, 
    but how discernable is it? The app helps you in getting 
    a prescription that is unambiguous. It also classifies 
    the timings at which you have to take the medicine. 
    ```

**Uses**
  ```
  The app will be of great help to the elder people 
  because of the simplicity of its UI. Just as the name suggests, 
  the doctor can feed in the the details of the medicine and 
  an  image ,providing a means for the patient to  easily figure out 
  which medicines to take. The patient can figure out which medicine 
  to take can  without reading the names written in tiny alphabets 
  on the tablet strips and the doctor’s prescription written in 
  unintelligible handwriting.So here we a have a good gift for 
  our grandparents or people who don’t have strong eyesight!

**Future Scope**
  ```
  Over the long term, this app has the potential 
  to replace the traditional system of paper based prescriptions.
