# Rx

**Introduction**
    
 You might go to a doctor and get a prescription, but how discernable is it? The app helps you in getting a prescription that is unambiguous. It also classifies the timings at which you have to take the medicine. 
  

**Uses**


  The app will be of great help to the elder people because of the simplicity of its UI. Just as the name suggests, the doctor can feed in the the details of the medicine and an  image ,providing a means for the patient to  easily figure out which medicines to take. The patient can figure out which medicine to take can  without reading the names written in tiny alphabets on the tablet strips and the doctor’s prescription written in unintelligible handwriting.So here we a have a good gift for our grandparents or people who don’t have strong eyesight!
  
**Stand-Out Features**
- Classifies medicines into four classes according to the period of the day in which they must be taken(breakfast,lunch,evening/snack time,dinner).
- This provides the user with an easy to use mechanism to quickly recognize the medicines to be taken at that time.
- Provides a facility to differentiate between different kinds of medicines,by attaching appropriate images. 
- The app also sends reminders and notifications from time to time,making sure the elderly stick to their schedule.


**Future Scope**
 
 
 Over the long term, this app has the potential to replace the traditional system of paper based prescriptions.
 
 **Features of the New 2.0 Version**

- Change in medicines made is immediately reflected back in database 
- Reminder feature is still there along with the classification and beautiful UI

**Note**

    ```I am using a free WebSever 000webhost which has limit however, the people interested in carrying it forward may expand the size of the server according to their needs and customize the app. This is just a demo to show the future possibilities and how we can make use of technology. Enjoy using Rx 2.0 before my free hosting expires :P !
